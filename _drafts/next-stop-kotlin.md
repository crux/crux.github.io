title: Next Stop Kotlin for Android?
excerpt_separator: <!--end-of-excerpt-->

[Steve Yegges] post made me think again about checking out [Kotlin]. He mades a pretty convincing case for switching over to [Kotlin for Android], even calls it the best language you can possibily get for programming Android.

Of course it helps to boost a language when Google makes it an official supported tool for its Android platform. A move which leads Yegge to call Android the Killer App for Kotlin. Sound possible, I don't know, but what I do know is that I share a lot of the pain points about developing. My long time hope was for the cross platform HTML approach, frameworks like [cordova], [ionic], [Electron]/[Photon] and javascript in general. Last week I made little test, checked out some simple banal node.js app from a co-worker of mine. I wanted to count LOC in my local dev dir after installing the neccesary node dependencies. Came up with a total of **more than 5000 files!**. This approach is a total desaster.
