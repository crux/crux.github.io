This is me playing around with technologies. Ever since it started, with
assembly of an Apple II clone and learning to program it in the 80ties. Became
a multimedia artist and VR pioneer in the 90ties. Worked the internets but
failed to become a billionaire in the noughties. Today I enjoy living, at least
partially, the original star trek utopian vision and still hope for more parts
of it to fulfil. Flatscreens and mobiles are not the most important ones but a
post capitalist society would be.

### More Information

Programming for decades might make me a software guy. With 10+ years of C++, Java, Ruby each I consider myself qualified to have a strong opinion on language topics but with such an perspective I usually prefer to focus on the bigger picture. System architecture is what makes or brakes a solution, not the performance of the programming language. Like in the old saying: "You can write bad FORTRAN in any language". Distributed systems, which where supercomputers in the 90ties, is what I like and now it is the internet with it's web scale architectures where it all happens.
