This is me playing around with technologies. Ever since I started it. Assembled an Apple II clone and learned to program it in the 80ties, became a multimedia artist and VR pioneer in the 90ties, worked the internets but failed to become a millionaire in the noughties. Today I enjoy living in the parts from the original star trek utopian vision but still hope for others to fulfil. Flatscreens and mobiles are not the most important ones. 

### More Information

Programming for decades might make me a software guy. With 10+ years of C++, Java, Ruby each I consider myself quite qualified to have an opinion on language topics but with such an perspective I usually prefer to focus on the bigger picture. The system architecture is what makes or brakes a solution, not the performance of the programming language. As you might have heard the old saying: You can write bad FORTRAN in any language. Distributed systems, which where supercomputers in the 90ties, is what I like and now it is the internet with it's web scale architectures.
