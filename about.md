This is me, playing around with technologies ever since it started. From
assembling an Apple II and learning to code it in the 80ties to becoming a
multimedia artist and VR pioneer in the 90ties. I worked the internets but
failed to become a billionaire in the noughties. Today I enjoy living, at least
partially, the original star trek utopian vision and looking forware to more
parts of it to fulfil. Flatscreens and mobiles are not the most important ones
but a post capitalist society could be it.

### More Information

Programming for decades might make me a software guy. With 10+ years of C++,
Java, Ruby each I consider myself qualified to have a strong opinion on
language topics. From that perspective I generally prefer to focus on the
bigger picture where the system architecture is what makes or brakes a solution
and not the performance of the programming language. Like in the old saying:
"You can write bad FORTRAN in any language". Distributed systems where
supercomputers in the 90ties. That is what I like and now it is the internet
with its web scale architectures where it all happens.
