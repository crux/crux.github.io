This is me, playing around with technologies ever since it started. From
assembling an Apple II and learning to code it in the 80ties to becoming a
multimedia artist and VR pioneer in the 90ties. I worked the internets but
failed to become a billionaire in the noughties. Today I enjoy living, at least
partially, the original star trek utopian vision and looking forward to even
more parts of it to fulfill. Flat screens and mobiles are not the most
important ones, but our way towards post-capitalist society might become interesting.

Programming for decades might also make me a software guy. With 10+ years of
C++, Java, Ruby each I consider myself qualified to have a strong opinion on
software topics and, more importantly, the people and methods defining it. I
generally prefer to focus on the bigger picture where the system architecture
is what makes or brakes a solution and not the performance of the programming
language. Like in the old saying: *"You can write bad FORTRAN in any
language"*. 

Last century, it was the distributed supercomputers I liked, now it is the
internet with its web-scale architectures and the multi-billion size
communities where it all happens, which we all love and loathe.
