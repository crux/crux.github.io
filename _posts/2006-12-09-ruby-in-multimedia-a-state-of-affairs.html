<p>ruby is the shiny new jewel for attacking all and any programming task. But it a has a dirty secret. No, i'm not talking performance here. I don't usally care for performance, it hardly doesn't matter with fast machines and low volume traffic. I'm talking about multimedia and thereby i basically mean gfx. A while ago i already checked for OpenGL bindings and in the past i played with <a href="http://rmovie.rubyforge.org/">rmovie</a>, scruffy, gruffy and RMagick. RMagick is kind of mature and it got the job done. Still, I don't get to like RMagick though, that might be to the fact i did(and learned) coding on <a href="http://www.sgi.com/">SGI</a> machines for <a href="http://www.sgi.com/company_info/newsroom/press_releases/2006/may/sgi_reorg.html">way to long</a>(sigh), more than 10 years. There i got used to/hooked on the basic idea of integrated multimedia environments. SGI was way ahead at their times and it was a pleasure to join them on their ride, while it lasted(most of the time, but that is another story, for the history books maybe -&gt; serious fun with sirus(tm) boards).</p>
<p>Nowerdays i make a living out of everything centered around internet related lifestyle oriented marketing driven projects, huh. Despite this prosaic description that is ok, actually it is great. I have a lot of really great cool people around me, working with them is a pleasure. But still, sometimes i got reminded to some old projects of mine and actually have the task of undusting some stuff for beeing revitalized in a museal context and than i go and check for updates of the above mentions mumedia bindings. And that is no fun. Way to slow progress there. I would love dropping all old-school technology(c++, Java) and just use ruby for taming the the beast (beast in this case are all modern gfx cards). <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> is java and can't win my heart. My current hope now is <a href="http://g3d-ruby.rubyforge.org/">G3DRuby.&nbsp; </a>And here is the deal: I will try my very best to help establishing solid multimedia bindings for ruby. For Q3 2007 i have an exhibition scheduled, until then i will look for places in opensource multimedia ruby land which might need a helping hand. <a href="mailto:mu-media-ruby@sebrink.de">Requests welcomed.</a> </p>
