Actually it surprises me that the internet exploder users still make up a 10% percent share on my blog. My personal experience tends to be different. More often than not it looks a little like seen below.

Anyhow, the 10% internet explorer usage fits nicely with another or my stats from Google Analytics:

The 'Connection Speed' distribution numbers for modem users are actually an exact match to the Internet Exploder numbers. Hmm, coincidence?

Maybe, but just in any case, let me give a warm hello to the seemingly web-savvy internet wizzards still surfing the net on their modem lines with Internet exploder and Windows. God luck, but rest assured you&nbsp; won't find 'optimized for IE' stuff here.

have fun

p.s.: yes, I spoiled actual visitor numbers. You just don't know the timeslot.<br />&nbsp;
