<p>I have no idea what <a href="http://www.zombo.com/">Zombo.com</a> stands for but "<span style="font-style:italic;">everything is possible"</span>. Words just don't do justice to its briliance.<span style="font-style:italic;"> "The unattainable is unknown to zombo.com"</span>, trust me, go listen to it and experience a true 2.0 marketing masterpiece. Hint: don't look for interaction, just listen to it.</p>
<p>cheers</p>
