<p>this is not a blog post! it's been ages since i've blogged. at least it feels like. and  more things happend, then i can possible blog about. i crashed my disk, i switched my laptop(two events, not one), and i went on holidays, twice. </p>
<p>of course there's always lots of planning of things to come on my side, but just to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTzA_xesrL8">not loose those things in rain</a>, i <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2007/08/23/dltumblelogging123.xml">try chris' tumblelog format</a> and just dump my unsorted eclectic mix of random samplings onto you, hopefully for your viewing pleasure. be my guest, have fun.</p>
<p>got asked by my CEO about our .NET experience but <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/8/23/Rails-vs-NET">didn&#8217;t dare to send her this</a>.</p>
<p>Flickr opens up to <a href="http://www.yswfblog.com/blog/2007/08/29/flickr-now-even-more-flash-friendly/">even more flashy crossdomain scripting</a> with <a href="http://static.flickr.com/crossdomain.xml">new crossdomain.xml file (http://static.flickr.com/crossdomain.xml)</a></p>

<p>Go off limits in Second Life, camera-wise at least. Use <strong>Opt-Ctrl-D</strong>(or Ctrl-Alt-D on PC) to <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/User:Torley_Linden/Debug_Settings">show/enable the <em>client menu</em> entry</a> and than <a href="http://blog.secondlife.com/2007/08/30/tip-of-the-week-how-to-move-your-camera-further-and-better/"><em>Disable Camera Constraints(Cmd-Opt-C)</em></a></p>
<p><a href="http://shtikl.com/2007/you-dont-need-a-plan-you-need-skills-and-a-problem/">da is was dran</a>: You don&#8217;t need a plan, you need skills and a problem. 1. Don&#8217;t start out with big plans. 2. Work on skills. 3. Apply your skills to a problem. Most plans are rubbish. Business plans are fake.</p>
<p>What a weird programming can that be that allows you to say things like: <a href="http://rebelscience.blogspot.com/2007/08/cosa-vs-erlang.html">COSA is inherently non-algorithmic</a>?</p>
<p><a href="http://tinker.it/now/2007/08/20/prototyping-for-events/">The video dress he developed for Hussein Chalayan was made of a few thousands chips all powered with a battery whose life lasted 2 minutes</a>, like, where to go when you have no limits.</p>
<p><a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/08/25/groups-for-twitter-or-a-proposal-for-twitter-tag-channels/">&#8221;I&#8217;m more interested in simply having a better eavesdropping experience on Twitter&#8221;</a>. YEAH! proposing a twitter ad-hoc grouping schema.</p>

<p>Implement binary search in erlang and learn that doing the right thing in the wrong language <a href="http://erlane-project.blogspot.com/2007/08/binary-search-ultimate-test.html">turns out to be totally inefficient</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/">2008 SXSW Interactive Panel Picker</a>, so at least i can browse the panel proposal of the SXSW festival. I would love to go there.</p>
<p><a href="http://reality.org/2007/08/19/recent-crv-investments-twitter-social-media/">Susan Wu got it all right on social media and twitter</a> where: <strong><em>We&#8217;re now ..moving into a client agnostic(Flash, Ajax, Facebook-centric, or MySpace-centric) era, where clients &#8230; are marketing channels&#8230; ..creating standards around specific user behaviors .. is the key asset ..A client should be an interpretation of a user group&#8217;s needs within a specific context(by &#8216;context&#8217;, I mean the 14-18 year old females on Facebook have a different community ethos than the 14-18 year old females on MySpace&#8230;)</em></strong>.</p>
