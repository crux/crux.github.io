<p>yep, here we go. It took a while but our chief operating foto-foo wizard steffen did finally approve the flickr upload service in http://foto-foo.com. No such big surprise here, beacause Flickr was in the text of the site ever since, it simply was not online yet. And now it is</p>
<p>I hope to find lots and lots of free wifi at garda see in italia so i upload directly from the waterfront. Yes, I go on vacation for two weeks. </p>
<p>happy foto-foo'ing<br /></p>
