<p><a href="http://project.ioni.st/post/966#post-966">this code</a> is a piece of art. It was the most inspiring use of ruby i've seen in a while. First there is:</p>
<pre>class &lt;&lt; TODOS = IO.read('TODO')
  # hand made TODO api here
end</pre>
<p>which wraps the String just loaded from disk in its very own, perfectly suited API. This is like hand made english cut vs. H&amp;M. And than there is:</p>
<pre>items.grep(regexp).instance_eval do
   def display
     # custom display function here
   end
end</pre>
<p>which again, does nicely fit a custom API around the found data. Doing it on the fly, no base classes, interfaces or and other sign of bothering the user with extraneous code. I just love it.</p>
