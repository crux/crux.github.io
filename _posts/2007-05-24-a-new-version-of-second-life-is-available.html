<p>doesn't that sound strange? The recent hype around all things virtual drove down normality of these ephemeral worlds to a new level. A lot is in the name, and readings like these constant flow of update messages from Linden Labs reminds me to the the supermarket announcer coming from the speakers above my head with: <span style="font-style:italic;">"please switch to another channel. this reality is not longer supported"</span>, while i was just pondering about my weekend shoppings. Or was it? Just kidding, I'm still part of the real world, am I? Distant associations to forgotten utopian views from the past. "Welt am Draht", welcome on the next level.</p>
