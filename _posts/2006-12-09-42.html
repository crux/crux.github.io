<p>I turned 42. You know, the ultimate answer to the question about everything and so. Later that day i did lay some tarrot cards, the 3 card oracle and i got sun, jing-jang and the universe for past, present and future. not bad. i have a car somewhere standing in a shelter for years now already. Quite rotten and in desperate need of a major overhaul. But now, with such cards, i will aim for getting it back onto the road before ending my 42nd year. The car is a Jag XJC 4.2 of course. You can read the signs?</p>
