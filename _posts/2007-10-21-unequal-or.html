<p>some simple ruby code:</p>
<pre><code>a = nil || 23
b = nil or 23
puts "#{a==b}"</code></pre>
<p>prints: <code>false</code>. Please explain! I mean explain in the sense of why not how it happens. Is it meaningful to put '||' and 'or' on a different level in the precedence hierarchy?</p>
<p><em>UPDATE:</em>  i checked a couple of times before i posted but still can't reproduce it a day later. don't know what  was different yesterday, Jruby? confused, ... i seem that <code>puts "#{a == b}"</code> prints true. today.</p>
