Found [kottke.org] referencing this [The Nerdwriter]'s video essay to
the understanding of [David Fincher's work]. It shows how Fincher highjacks
your eyes by his very complex but still very subtle camera works.

<!--end-of-excerpt-->
I am a visual person, like most people, most of the time, and it feels really
good learning from the very best in designing visual communications. Because
that is what it's all about, creating communications, creating emotions,
emerging people in meaning. 

Fascinated? Then continue right away, with [David Fincher - Invisible Details].
