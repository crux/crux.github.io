<p>getting into testing frenzy, posting videos from YouTUBE to the blog.</p>
<p>What i don't get is, i need uname and pass, ok, but what for they want an wordpress API KEY and the API URL for it on the YouTUBE side? The API URL turns out just to be the blog posting url(../xmlrpc.php in my case) which still leaves me with the question of what do they need the my API key for? account credentials should be sufficient. tbc|investigated...</p>
<p>update: i couldn't get the YouTube posting to work, the embedded video you see above got inserted manually, sigh. </p>
<p>Internet i must say, we're not yet there, not even close...</p>
