<blockquote>"In a sense, there are only five computers on earth." He[Prabhakar Raghavan, Yahoo Research Chief] lists Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon.&nbsp; Few others, he says, can turn electricity into computing power with comparable efficiency. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/print/magazine/content/07_52/b4064048925836.htm">(businessweek.com)<br /></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Gain your insights from the businessweek article on Google's 101 course in which they start teaching web-scale computing in the universities. This is how they reach out to find new generations of engineers to fuel the never-ending appetite of the Googleplex for young brains.</p>
<p>and remember, just because your paranoid doesn't mean they not out there to get you. </p>
