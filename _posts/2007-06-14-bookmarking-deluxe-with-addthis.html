<p>What <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/05/addthis-widget-gathering-lots-of-interesting-data/">techcrunch is doing</a> can't be wrong, not totally wrong at least i hope. So lets see, <a href="http://www.addthis.com/">AddThis!</a> seems to finally solve the bookmarking issue once and for all by just taking it out of your hands completly and leaving the freedom of choice in the hand of the readers. It took me less than 2 minutes to click through their <a style="font-style:italic;" href="http://www.addthis.com/web-button-select.html">"Get your free widget"</a> site and i had <a href="http://www.sofasportler.de/test/AddThis.html">my personal bookmark button(test page)</a>. </p>
<p>And than, you get statistics pages for free, (techcrunchs, not mine though, sigh): <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/addthis560.png" /><br />...and as you can see from the charts, <a href="http://www.addthis.com/">AddThis</a> does RSS Feeds too. </p>
<p>Is this all? Nope, there is more, of course a <a href="http://blog.addthis.com/?p=24">AddThis! Wordpress Plugin is available</a> as well. But you go figure that out for yourself, i guess. </p>
<p>have(a lot of) fun<br />cheers</p>
<p>ps.: and(thx to wp plugin) try the bookmark button under this article ;-)</p>
