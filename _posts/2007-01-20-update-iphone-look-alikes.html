<p><img style="float:right;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/363662115_f564e7c18a.jpg?v=0" alt="" class="reflect" height="171" width="223" /><a href="http://www.sofasportler.de/dirk.blog/2007/01/10/no-more-thing/">I joked a little </a>about the absurd prospect of expecting the asian companies to patiently wait for Apple to launch their iPhone. But in a kind of actio-reactio reversed surprising quantum world move the response was there before the action. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.lge.com/about/press_release/detail/PRO%7CNEWS%5EPRE%7CMENU_20328_PRE%7CMENU.jhtml">LG in conjunction with PRADA</a> did launch a slick touchscreen device and <a href="http://www.prada.com/">PRADA</a> might turn out out to be the perfect partner to get it right with successfully locking on to the luxury target group. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I still believe in the iPhone becoming a huge success. There is a reason why there is hardly any mention of the software. Software makes all the difference nowerdays. I personally definitly won't fuddling around with yet another stupid gadget. And it doesn't have multitouch either.</p>
