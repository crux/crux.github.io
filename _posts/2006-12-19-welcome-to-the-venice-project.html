<p>i got my the-venice-project beta test player download credentials on saturday. That is two days ago and i didn't even found time to check it out. When i can believe what the papers say, i'm part of a 6000 people strong elite! Yeah! I feel so special now. Just in case you don't now, The Venice Project <br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www.theveniceproject.com/">combines the best things about television with the social power of the internet</a></p></blockquote>
<p>and is the next project of the guys which brought to us KaZaa and Skype before. So it might be worth checking out. And i really would like to do so, but it is windows only, argh. so i have to wait for being in the office on tuesday. today on monday, what an irony, i had no chance, because i spend the day in zagreb to visit the strategic IPTV project of two major german companies in the croation market. What can i say about the trip? Nothing i've seen will be part of the future of television/iptiv, that is for sure. Nothing worth talking about, only a nice picture i made, which i post tomorrow when i found the cam cable. </p>
<p>And The Venice Project?  <span style="font-style:italic;">"So please don't give the application to anybody else.."</span>, ok, not quite unusual, but <span style="font-style:italic;">"..., or even show it to them"</span>???</p>
<p>What the hell they are thinking? Do they expect me to become part of their secret armee just by signing up for a beta? And<span style="font-style:italic;"> "We hope you enjoy helping us create the future of TV", </span>yeah, sure you do.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">"It's very early days for us, and we want to make sure that the right people see the right software, at the right time"</p>
<p></span>I can't decide. Do they want to make fun of me? Is this honest marketing? Do they now want me to keep the player secret or just want to force the opposite? I will check the player on tuesday and let you know, and who knows? Maybe i even post my very personalized beta venice player beta test account here. And that would be my very first cliffhanger now. </p>
<p>cheers<br />&nbsp;</p>
