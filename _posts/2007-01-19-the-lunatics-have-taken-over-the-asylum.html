<p>in Monschau, Germany(the middle of nowhere), <span style="font-style:italic;">"The Web´s most ambitious RUBY ON RAILS Startup"</span> started looking for some fellow ruby coder to kick-off their project. But there is a twist, a big one: <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />MUST BE BORN BETWEEN JULY 24 AND AUGUST 22 OR NOVEMBER 23 AND DECEMBER 19 AND BE BETWEEN 18 AND 99 YEARS YOUNG</span> </p>
<p>And seemingly the search with increasing despair:<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://rubynow.com/jobs/show/831">15th Jan: Startup looking for web designer/programmer/co-founder</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://rubynow.com/jobs/show/833">16th Jan: The Web´s most ambitious RUBY ON RAILS Startup based in Monschau Germany is looking for a Ruby on Rails guru to lead our development team as Co-founder and Co-CEO</a></p></blockquote>
<p>and latest to date:<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://rubynow.com/jobs/show/847">18th Jan: The most ambitious Ruby on Rails project calls for a Rail’s guru to lead team as Co-founder</a></p></blockquote>
<p>RoR, TDD, AJAX!, scalable websites, whatever you like, you name it you get it, its all there and you can become <span style="font-style:italic;">"importend"</span> part and development team lead, Co-founder even!<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><br /></span>"<span style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 23 AND DECEMBER 19 ", </span>sigh, and so another bright future fades away for me, 16th Nov, misssed by a few days, phew.</p>
<p>oh, and some more requirements are piling up, you won't make it without <br />
<blockquote>a deep love for humanity and the relentless will to facilitate happiness and emotional fulfilment for all. </p></blockquote>
<p>yep, ok for me!, but as i said, wrong dates. The position is "Full-Time", but please keep in mind:<a href="http://simplyooh.com/"><br /></a><br />
<blockquote>There is no immediate compensation for the first few months. Once the first round of financing is finalized then we will begin paying a salary.</p></blockquote>
<p> so better bring you own, for the <span style="font-style:italic;">"entrepreneurial"</span> spirit i guess. Me beeing you would contact <a href="mailto:GabriellavonSchadewitz@simplyooh.com/">Gabriella von Schadewitz</a> right away in case i would be more lucky with the stars.</p>
<p>have fun</p>
