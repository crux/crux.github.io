<p>go read the <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/your-privacy-is-an-illusion/apple-tracks-which-stocks-you-follow-on-your-iphone-324378.php">valleywag on "Apple tracks which stocks you follow on your iPhone"</a> to find out how apple shows interesst in what you're doing. Oh what lucky bastards we all are. At least Google take care of us all and does not exploit our privacy. <br />
<blockquote>"All mobile devices possess a unique International Mobile Equipment Identity number, and as the screenshot below indicates, the iPhone sends its user's unique IMEI to an Apple server each time the widgets perform a query. The data includes which stock ticker was queried."</p></blockquote>
<p>just imagine. </p>
<p>and have fun</p>
