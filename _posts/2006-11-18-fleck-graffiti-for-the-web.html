<p>for testing purpose i made some <a href="http://extension.fleck.com/?sh=aef99e5c7f4830a5ae8c84b897389248315ae926">notes onto a web site of mine</a> with the <a href="http://www.fleck.com">fleck</a> annotation/graffiti tool for web pages. What can i say, it just works. One more proof for the feasebility of the concepts i tried to sell my client for nearly most of the year now, to no avail. They just don't see it, they are focused on business models :-) About which i just agree with Mr. Fletcher:&nbsp; <br />
