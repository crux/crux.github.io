<p>You know, <br />
<blockquote>Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future.<br />--Nils Bohr, Nobel laureate in Physics</p></blockquote>
<p>agreed, but one thing is certain: it becomes way more complex than it used to be.</p>
<p>I recently just skimmed this <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/2007_web_predictions.php">2007 Web Predictions</a> and by quickly counting every major trend they identified in their post i figured out that I can't keep up with the progress any more. I can dive into any given topic deep enough to cope with it, but not more all of them at once. Personally I'm unable to&nbsp; accumulate information that fast anymore, and maybe it&nbsp; is also impossible for a company. You can always hire people, but besides the difficulty of getting the right ones, you start loosing focus. Beeing <span style="font-style:italic;">"a jack in all trades, master in none"</span> is no viable solution. </p>
<p>I recognize the pattern though. In the beginning, when i got started with the messy world of computers, i could keep up to date with all and every topic. Heck, there was only one (offline) magazine! "Byte", and much later than came, <a href="http://heise.de/">heise C't</a> for the german market.</p>
<p>After just&nbsp; a decade down the road, the web came and and funny enough, the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961019152337/http://byte.com/">earliest online reference of Bye magazine covers 3D graphics for everyone</a>. That was in '96 and now 10 years later i come back doing stuff with SecondLife. History is repeating itself? Or is it just me running around in circles? </p>
<p>have fun</p>
