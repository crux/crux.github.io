<p>Sorry for the german in the title, but i just stumbled over the coincidence of the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2007/1/19/rails-1-2-rest-admiration-http-lovefest-and-utf-8-celebrations">Rails 1.2.1 release</a> lines of code increased conforming to the german VAT update we got this januar. VAT is now 19% in Germany and ruby came from 6246 to 7428 lines of ruby code. That is an 18.924111431316 percent increase, which rounds up quite nicely to 19%. I checked against the last pre-1.2 release . </p>
<p>With 7428 lines of code rails still stays a lithe and lissom young framework. All the best for the REST. </p>
<p>cheers</p>
