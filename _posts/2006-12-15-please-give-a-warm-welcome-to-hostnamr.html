<p>Hi, we, new <a href="mailto:prodev@idmedia.com">product development @ idmedia</a>, just released <a href="http://www.idmedia.com/">i-dmedia's</a> first public facing ruby on rails webapplication: <a href="http://www.hostnamr.com">hostnamr</a></p>
<p>Please give it a warm welcome to <a href="http://www.hostnamr.com">hostnamr :: making names to remember</a>!</p>
<p> It is a <span style="font-style:italic;">tongue-in-cheek</span> kind of page which implements a somewhat old and simple concept. The basic idea came up more than 10 years ago between me and a friend of mine, steffen meschat at <a href="http://www.artcom.de/">art+com</a> (now with <a href="http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/">google</a>, <a href="http://web.mesch.org/log/">blog?</a>). When you have a set of syllables with vocals you can just combine them in any order and will always get speakable words. This works for italian operas and hiragana for example, so why not for generating hostnames? And when <a href="http://readme.moellus.de/">the cool dude downstairs</a> from the office was <a href="http://readme.moellus.de/node/159">joking about web2.0 hostnaming</a> a while ago i remembered that old idea and decided to put it up for a test. Following a new the trend i spotted, we made it a <span style="font-style:italic;">"one page web application"</span> and put it live. Now it is our start into the new venture of webapplications build on rubyonrails! when you like it, stay tuned for future updates.</p>
<p>have fun</p>
<p>ps.: We are hiring! looking for rubyonrails developers which want to make a difference. In case of interest, drop me a note: dluesebrink at idmedia com.<br />creating tomorrow</p>
