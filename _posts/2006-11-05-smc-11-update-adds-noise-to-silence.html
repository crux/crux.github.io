<p>I had a perfectly quiet MacBook. Contrary to the MacBook Pro of my friend i never expierenced any hissing sounds when idle or suffered from always running fans. This is history now after the recent SMC update of Apple. For keeping the macbooks cooler they <span style="font-style:italic;">tuned</span> the fan settings to effectivly keep the fan running all the time, at least with a mininum RPM. Whether the hissing sound is in direct relation to the fan speed i cannot tell yet. We are still speaking of a very low volume noise level here. You can't hear it at work in the office space so it took me a couple of days to realize this new reality, i just did not want to accept the truth. Now when stitting at home, sunday morning, quiet, coffee, i keep hearing it sizzling along. I would prefer my macbook getting hot instead of noisy, especially in the now upcoming berlin winter.</p>
<p>have fun</p>
