<p>i just called vodafon because my internet password was not working anymore. before sending a new password by SMS the operator did ask me for my secret phone password, so i told her. But she did actually not check it at all! How can i know? Because anytime i give my phone password, i have to spell it, the usual spelling differs from my password. Nice trick, just ask for a password to check peoples reaction to the question. secure, hu?</p>
