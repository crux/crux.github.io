<p>With all due respect, <br />

<p>is the most ridiculous version number jump i have seen i a while. Yahoo just released a new version of their <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo! UI Library</a> and pull this little marketing trick.</p>
<p>This is even more extreme than in the good old new economy times when marketing geniuses where pushing their fail-ups towards their IPOs.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, YUI is a fine piece of work and the <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/">yuiblog</a> a delighting source of inspiration. But no marketing blah-blah whatsoever will make me understand the reasoning behind going from below 1.0 to 2.2 in a single step. Get real, start at 1 please. </p>
<p>cheers</p>
