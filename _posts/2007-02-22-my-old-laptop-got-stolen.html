<p>the one i used before this macbook. R51 IBM Thinkpad with 2GB Ram, gentoo installed and a <a href="http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/">"ususal suspect" 21C3</a> sticker on back of the screen. not nice. i would not mind a miracle to bring it back. It was up and running and connected to the network when it got stolen on friday, 16. feb 07. </p>
