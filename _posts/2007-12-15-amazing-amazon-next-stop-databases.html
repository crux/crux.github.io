<p>amazon goes full circle with their webservices. After filesystem storage(S3) and raw computing power(EC2) with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=342335011">SimpleDB Amazons AWS</a> now delivers the last missing piece for any web app you may want to build. </p>
<p>Again like the other AWS before SimpleDB is build on a simple concept and implements the pay as you go payment model. With no upfront money you get access to their clustered, monitored HA database system.</p>
<p>Lots of people where already anticipating this because a database solution were so obiously missing. What is more surprising, is that <a href="http://www.satine.org/archives/2007/12/13/amazon-simpledb/">SimpleDB seems to be build on Erlang</a>. I don't know whether or not this will re-fuel the Erlang hype which kind of dwindled a bit since the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/">pragmatics released joe armstrongs Erlang book</a> earlier this year(note to self: should have posted my bookreview months ago). </p>
<p>Erlang, a kind of ugly/ancient language but full of beautiful concepts for scalable, reliable, distributed applications and this might get me moving again.</p>
