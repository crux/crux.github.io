<p>Stumbling again over the <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/story.php.id.8795.s.8.jsp#5" /><a href="http://www.gartner.com/pages/story.php.id.8795.s.8.jsp#5">gardner group</a> <a href="http://secondlife.reuters.com/stories/2007/01/04/gartner-says-second-life-hype-near-peak/">SL hype cycle</a> today i couldn't resist applying this little fix to it. Those which still care for SL will know what i mean. For the others, don't bother, looks like you won't need to watch out for Linden Labs Second Life. Will they ever come back? </p>
<p>Virtual Worlds, mainly in the form of Virtual Goods(<a href="http://www.google.de/search?q=warcraft+gold&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">GOLD</a>!) will be become bigger and bigger over the years, but this will happen without SL. And rightfully so. Their client is still really bad. No fun in starting it up on my laptop, so i don't. </p>
<p>If you ever checked the super ugly absolutly non-maintainable <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Open_Source_Portal">source code* of the open source client</a>, you can't hold back to interpret this as another example of an solution which was not ready to deliver once the markets where ripe for conquer. </p>
<p>have fun</p>
<p>* and don't forget, <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Open_Source_Portal">"use the source, luke!"</a></p>
