Now this is interesting (for me). There is supposedly scientific evidence that
modern pop music IS actually worse than ever before in history.

It comes (to me) from an [BBC] article (via [slashdot]). Their claims are in
contrast to what I feel, in contrast to my believe (and hope) that _history is
actually progressing_. I do not think it was all better back than. I grew up
with [Bay City Rollers] and they were crap. On the other side, I have a strong
trust in the scientific method, and that report seems legit. Now, how come? Is
it just me, or can I resolve this obvious mismatch somehow? There are two
thoughts I have which might explain this and I would like to know what you are
thinking. 

First, for the statistical part. My explanation would be that todays
**interesting** music is happening much more outside the main stream and by
that becomes plain unaccesible to the statistical analysis. When they take the
billboard charts, bandcamp, soundcloud, myspace and various other means of
modern social media based distribution channels simply go invisible to them.
That would not matter, as their claims are about to the overall general trend
which they report, but point in case here is, this analysed main stream is a
much much smaller share of the overall music today then it was in the good old
past of the 70'ties or even 80ties, 90ties. Music in 1980 maybe was covered to
80% by what's in the billboard charts. Today it might be less than 40% of what
is relevant, that even shows up there at all. I don't have the real numbers
here, but the principle holds and if this is true, the scientific findings only
tell the story of an ever smaller part of music and hardly reflect on the
vibrant variety and diversity of modern (pop) culture. 

Second, there is the demoscopic argument. They report from the polls that over
all age groups people thought the current decade has the worst music, with the
past decades getting better numbers the longer they were gone. This is in #4 of
the [BBC] article. What I think is that this is strictly a _relative_ finding.
If they would have made the same poll in 2000 it would have been again the then
current decade, the 90ties, which would have got polled the worst. And again in
1980, the majority of people would have said the 80ties where worse then the
glorious 70ties. And on, and on, and on it goes. Personally I think there the
90ties were really bad. Techno, and with it the modern electronic music, the
only interesting thing emerging from it. 

Here is the thing with statistics: the majority of menkind has an above average
number of arms. Think about it. If you made it this far, you deserve some of
the best pop of our times, 

have fun
