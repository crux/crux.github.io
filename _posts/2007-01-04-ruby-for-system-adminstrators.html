<p>From the <span style="font-style:italic;">"Weichet von mir Dämonen!"</span> department here is a little helper i found for the would-be ruby savvy system adminstraters. The <a href="http://daemons.rubyforge.org/">Daemons</a> ruby gem  by <a href="http://physiker.ch/?page_id=4">Thomas Uehlinger</a> is a very welcomed replacment for the shell and perl scripting mess you do for half of the day. </p>
<blockquote><p> <a href="http://daemons.rubyforge.org/classes/Daemons.html">Daemons</a> provides: .... scripts&nbsp; to be <em>run as a daemon</em> and to be <em>controlled by simple start/stop/restart commands</em>. </p>
<p> ... <em>run blocks of ruby code </em>and control these processes from the main application. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p> ...offers many advanced features like <em>exception backtracing</em> and logging and <em>monitoring</em> </p>
<p>...and automatic restarting of your processes if they crash.</p></blockquote>
<p>I spread the word here as part of my ruby evangelizing efforts to bring light into your scripting hell and as maybe your first step onto the path of ruby enlightenment.</p>
<p>have fun</p>
