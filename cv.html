Objective:

CTO, COO, CEO or possibly serial interim CTO, in a medium and international
organisation, preferably operating in the field of internet services, consumer

media at the convergence of communications, technology, TV and entertainment.

Skills Summary:

Department management:
    manage budgets, employee communications, intranet, recruiting, training
    and development, hiring, firing, counselling, and organisational
    development, contract negotiating, compensation surveys, salary ranges.


IT platforms and methodologies:
    Difficult to say, because basically I touched whatever tech was out there
    the last 30 years. As a software developer I have 10+ years experience in
    each of Java, Javascript, C++ & Ruby and their corresponding platforms. I
    signed the Agile Manifesto and did eXtreme programming even before that. I
    promoted SCRUM and Kanban into my own departments, spread it and transformed
    projects and clients towards agile processes around me.

    From supercomputers to HTML5 one page apps, from embedded controllers
    to scripting to DSLs to massive parallel optimised code. From relational to
    NoSQL to graph databases, from computer graphics to VR/AR to social networks
    to AI to games to medical solutions. My sustained interest is in complex
    distributed system architectures, in software and programming and the
    methods needed to build platforms and ecosystems to scale development
    beyond a single person and short time scales. Deployments I like continuous
    and in the clouds of Amazon, Google or building my own.
    
    I am a generalist with a deep understanding of system designs, software
    development and the human and business process dynamics surrounding it.
    
Corporate Officer:
    Board of Directors, consultants, contractors, subcontractors.

Education: 
    Informatik (Computer Science) TU Berlin 88 - 93, and FU Berlin 2005/06.
    I exmatriculated on starting ART+COM as a founding member.
